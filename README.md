ORMLiteExample
==============

Learning android database interactions using ORMLite

This application makes request to [MiWay Mobile Site] (http://m.miway.ca/routes.jsp), parses html to get routes and save all routes data in database using ORMLite.

Steps : 
==============
1. Parse html response recived from http://m.miway.ca/routes.jsp
2. Create list of all routes 
3. Create Routes database table using ORMLite
4. Save all parsed routes in table using ORMLite
5. Show routes from database in simple listview.

Information about table created
==================================

For this example, I created a simple table "Route". With ORMLite, I used annotation like 
- @DatabaseTable(tableName = "route") : to specifiy table
- @DatabaseField(generatedId = true) : autogenerated id
- @DatabaseField(index = true, unique = true) : for unique record
- @DatabaseField : all other database fields

Viewing database created in emulator
============================

To see table "route" and its content, I used SQLBrowser. Downloaded it from [here] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/)

Steps to extract database file from eclipse

1. Make sure your emulator is running.
2. Open DDMS perispective in eclipse.
3. Go to File Explorer. (If File Explorer is empty, open 'devices' view)
4. Select running activity from device. (For this application it is 'com.ormlite.activity')
5. In File Explorer, all the contents will be displayed.
6. Open data\data\com.ormlite.activity\databases
7. You will see db file - 'ormlite_app_data'
8. Select that file and click 'save' icon in top right corner. (Pull a file from the device)
9. Save the file on your local drive, and open it using sqllitebrowser.
